## Contributing

Please come help me work on this project. It needs security hardening, performance optimizations, and lots of features added. Don't hesitate to make a PR!

The code base is a bit of a mess, but it is still quite small. So, it shouln't be hard to clean up.

The tech stack is React, NodeJS, MongoDB, and Docker.

### Roadmap

  - Migrate to MVC architecture with repository layer
